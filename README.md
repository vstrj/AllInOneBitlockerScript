# AllInOneBitlockerScript
When finished, it should be able to encrypt, re-encrypt, un-encrypt, upload to azure AD or not.  Mostly not finished.


The base code is "forked" from:  https://github.com/alaurie/Intune_Bitlocker 

I'm too much of a github noob to know how real forking works.


Things to do:

Add switch parameter for Fully Encrypted vs Used Space Only Encryption

Add new upload to AAD Fuction nad switch paramter
